# Charge

Lets assume you want to authorize or settle an amount on the payment data that you have collected earlier.

You can simply `send an XML request with a token to charge the stored card.`

> _For this feature, you need an existing acquiring contract. Please see our list of _[_**Supported Acquirer**_](../resources/supported-acquirer.md)_._

| Charge an amount | Reserve an amount | Recur transaction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Make a payment against a stored credit card. | Block an amount on a stored credit card. | Reuse stored credit card data for recurring transactions or One-Click payments. |

## 1. Add an Acquirer to your Account

You can choose from a list of [**Supported Acquirer**](../resources/supported-acquirer.md).

## 2. Charge a stored credit card

If you have added an Acquirer to your account, you can either use the Payment Page or a Server-to-Server request to charge a token.

### via Payment Page

When using the Payment Page , all possible input fields are getting pre-filled. See example:

| [Charge stored credit card via Payment Page](https://pay.sandbox.datatrans.com/upp/jsp/upStart.jsp?theme=DT2015&merchantId=1100004624&amount=1337&currency=CHF&refno=123456789&sign=30916165706580013&paymentmethod=VIS&aliasCC=70119122433810042&expm=12&expy=18&language=en) |
| :--- |


In the example above the CVV code for the payment method \(VIS\) is mandatory. The payment page is getting pre-filled with the masked credit card number and the expiry date only. The cardholder is asked to enter the CVV code only for a simplified payment process.

Open the following URL with parameters:

```javascript
https://pay.sandbox.datatrans.com/upp/jsp/upStart.jsp            // HOST: Payment Page Endpoint
                ?theme=DT2015                                
                &merchantId=1100004624                       // Merchant ID you received at adding a Acquirer
                &amount=1337                                 // Specify the amount you want to authorize
                &currency=CHF                                // Specify currency in which you want to charge
                &refno=123456789                             // Unique ID for reference - assigned by you
                &sign=30916165706580013                      // Security Sign you created in Step 1
                &paymentmethod=VIS                           // Specify the payment method you want to charge
                &aliasCC=424242SKMPRI4242                    // CC token to identify stored credit card number
                &aliasCVV=LfDiiolgQ86kRSyNEXyx8jwU           // CVV token to identify stored CVV code
                &expm=12                                     // Expiry Month of stored credit card
                &expy=18                                     // Expiry Year of stored credit card
                &language=en                                 // Define language in which Payment Page should be opened
```

### via Server-to-Server Request \(One-Click Checkout\)

Send an XML request to Datatrans' XML Gateway Endpoint by using the following call:

```javascript
$ curl "https://api.sandbox.datatrans.com/upp/jsp/XML_authorize.jsp"         // HOST: XML Gateway Endpoint
        -H "Content-Type: application/xml"                             // Content-Type: application/xml

        -d '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>                    // We expect an XML formatted message       
                <authorizationService version="2">                     
                    <body merchantId="1000011011">                     // Merchant ID you received at adding a Acquirer
                        <transaction refno="123abc">                   // Unique ID for reference - assigned by you
                            <request>                                  
                                <amount>1000</amount>                  // Specify the amount you want to authorize
                                <currency>CHF</currency>               // Specify currency in which you want to charge
                                <aliasCC>424242SKMPRI4242</aliasCC>    // CC token to identify stored credit card
                                <aliasCVV>xxx</aliasCVV>               // CV token to identify stored CVV code
                                <expm>12</expm>                        // Expiry Month of stored credit card
                                <expy>15</expy>                        // Expiry Year of stored credit card
                                <sign>30916165706580013</sign>         // Security Sign you created in Step 1
                            </request>
                        </transaction>
                    </body>
                </authorizationService>'
```
