# Step 3 - Use stored cards

Now that you have your credit card token, you can make use of it.

PCI Proxy allows you to keep your existing business processes as before. As we connect every stored credit card number to a specific credit card token, you simply use the token to tell PCI Proxy what you want to do with the underlying credit card data.

With the following three methods you can use stored card data:

| &gt; [Charge](charge.md) a stored card | &gt; [Forward](forward/) a stored card | &gt; [Show](show.md) a stored card |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Use our payment gateway to charge or validate a stored card. | Pass stored card data on to any PCI-compliant Receiver. | Let authorized users manually de-tokenize stored card to see it. |
