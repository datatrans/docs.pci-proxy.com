# Step 1 - Setup

Before taking your integration live, use our Sandbox environment to test it thoroughly. The Sandbox environment is a self-contained testing environment, identical to our productive environment.

## 1. Create your Sandbox Account

Follow these steps to create your Sandbox account:

1. [**Sign up**](https://www.pci-proxy.com/pci-proxy/contact/) for a free 30-day trial account \(no billing information required\).
2. After a short internal confirmation, you will receive your preliminary Sandbox credentials.
3. [**Log in**](https://admin.sandbox.datatrans.com/) with your credentials and follow instructions to create your own password.

> Note you receive** two separate merchant IDs** when using [_Website Tokenization_](step-2-tokenize-and-store-cards/website-tokenization/) and [_Filter Payloads_](step-2-tokenize-and-store-cards/filter-payloads.md).

## 2. Setup your Sandbox Account

Create additional merchant identification to secure your communication.   
You will need this information for Step 2 and 3.
