# Release notes

## January 2021

**New parameter available - GET Status API**

We have added a new parameter `cardHolderInfo` in the response of the `/v1/transactions/{transactionId}` API request which returns the following information: 

_Text provided by the ACS/Issuer to Cardholder during a Frictionless transaction that was not authenticated by the ACS. The Issuer can optionally provide information to Cardholder. For example, “Additional authentication is needed for this transaction, please contact \(Issuer Name\) at xxx-xxx-xxxx.”_

## December 2020

#### New feature - Traffic inspector 

We have added a new feature to monitor and debug traffic in real time. Learn more about the Traffic Inspector [here](pci-proxy-dashboard/traffic-inspector.md). 

**Improvement - Usage statistics** 

We have improved the usage statistics in the PCI Proxy Dashboard. It allows you to filter usage each single integration assigned to your project on Contract level. 

## November 2020

**New APIs - Token management**

You can now interact with tokens stored in the PCI Proxy vault with our brand new Token management APIs. Check out [Manage ](../use-stored-cards/manage.md)to see how they work.
