# Add/Create Integrations

Before you can filter payloads from a remote server you have to add the remote server as an integration to your account. PCI Proxy provides you with over 400 preconfigured integrations to partners across all industries. In case you're missing one, add it within minutes by providing us with payload samples and related endpoints.

#### 1. Add existing integration to your account
