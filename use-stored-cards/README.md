# Use stored cards

PCI Proxy allows you to keep your existing business processes as before. As we connect every stored credit card number to a specific credit card token, you simply use the token to tell PCI Proxy what you want to do with the underlying credit card data.

With the following methods you can use stored card data:

{% page-ref page="forward/" %}

> Pass stored card data on to any PCI-compliant Receiver.

{% page-ref page="show.md" %}

> Let authorized users manually de-tokenize stored card to see it.

{% page-ref page="check.md" %}

> Use this API to validate an existing Token against the VISA, MasterCard and AMEX network

{% page-ref page="authorize-settle/" %}

> Use [Datatrans](https://www.datatrans.ch/en) payment gateway to charge or validate \(check\) a stored card.

{% page-ref page="manage.md" %}

> Use the manage api to have full control over your tokens.
