# Use stored cards

PCI Proxy allows you to keep your existing business processes as before. As we connect every stored credit card number to a specific credit card token, you simply use the token to tell PCI Proxy what you want to do with the underlying credit card data.

With the following methods you can use stored card data:

* **Forward - Pass stored card data on to any PCI-compliant Receiver:**

{% content-ref url="forward/" %}
[forward](forward/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

* **Show - Let authorized users manually de-tokenize stored card to see it:**

{% content-ref url="show.md" %}
[show.md](show.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

* **Check - Use this API to validate an existing Token against the VISA, MasterCard and AMEX network**

{% content-ref url="check.md" %}
[check.md](check.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

* **Authorize/Settle - Use **[**Datatrans**](https://www.datatrans.ch/en)** payment gateway to charge or validate (check) a stored card**

{% content-ref url="authorize-settle/" %}
[authorize-settle](authorize-settle/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

* **Manage - Get full control and interact with your tokens stored in our vault**

{% content-ref url="manage.md" %}
[manage.md](manage.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
