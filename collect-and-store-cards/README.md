# Collect & store cards

In general, you have different inbound channels where you receive sensitive card data from customers or partners. In order to avoid sensitive card data touching your systems, choose your source of credit card data and implement the respective PCI Proxy API.

With the following methods you can use collect & store cards:

{% page-ref page="filter-payloads/" %}

> Collect and tokenize payment data on incoming data streams

{% page-ref page="capture-iframes/" %}

> Customizable iframes to collect and tokenize payment data

{% page-ref page="mobile-sdk-beta.md" %}

> Collect and tokenize payment data with PCI Proxy from inside your native apps

{% page-ref page="vault-alias-gateway.md" %}

> Pass sensitive pamyent data directly to the PCI Proxy vault to create tokens

{% page-ref page="secure-file-transfer-sftp.md" %}

> Transmit and tokenize sensitive payment data via SFTP
