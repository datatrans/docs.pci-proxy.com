#### Interested in offering a brand-new mobile tokenisation experience? Join our closed beta!

We are developing Mobile SDKs for iOS and Android for native apps. We are currently working on improving UX and UI processes for an upcoming mobile SDK version. The new solution will offer a state-of-the-art tokenisation experience for mobile applications using native elements. We expect this new solution to be released by mid 2021. 

Get in touch with us today if you are interested in joining our closed beta and we'll make sure to advise you accordingly. Drop us a message anytime by using [this link](https://www.pci-proxy.com/pci-proxy/contact/) and we'll get back to you.
