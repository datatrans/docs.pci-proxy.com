# Authorize

An authenticated payment transaction can be authorized and settled by the following two ways:

* Do you want to authorize a payment transaction authenticated through either PCI Proxy [Secure Fields](../authentication-only/securefields-1/) or [3D API](../authentication-only/api-beta.md) ?   Please continue [here](authorize.md) 
* Do you want to authorize a payment transaction which was authenticated by a third party provider?   Please continue [here  ](authorize-with-3rd-party-authenticated-data.md)

### Before you start

Submitting authorization requests to both APIs requires an active acquiring and Datatrans PCI Proxy processing contract.
