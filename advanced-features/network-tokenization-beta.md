# Network Tokenization (beta)

PCI Proxy Network Tokenisation service is a beta feature that enables merchants to increase their payment success rate and improve their security. As of today, PCI Proxy is a certified Token Requestor Provider for Visa (VTS) and MasterCard (MDES) Network Tokenisation. Support for American Express (AETS) will be added later this year.&#x20;

## **Network Tokens**

Network Tokenisation is a concept introduced by the card schemes such as Visa, Mastercard, and AMEX, based on the technical framework provided by [EMVCo](https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/payment-tokenisation/).Thereby, a Network Token (also called DPAN) is a 16 digit Primary Account Number (PAN) alternative that is unique per each cardholder as well as per merchant. Like a regular PAN, Network Tokens can be used for completing e-commerce transactions or sharing them with other partners in the payment eco-system.&#x20;

By using PCI Proxy a Network Token will be automatically generated once a card number is collected through one of our [Collect](broken-reference) interfaces - without any further implementation effort on your side.&#x20;
