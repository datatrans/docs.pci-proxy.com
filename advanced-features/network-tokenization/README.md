# Network Tokenization

### **What is Network Tokenization?**&#x20;

Network Tokenisation is a tokenization concept introduced by the card schemes such as Visa, Mastercard, and AMEX. It is based on the technical framework provided by [EMVCo](https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/payment-tokenisation/). The Network Token (also called DPAN) is a 13-19 digit Primary Account Number (FPAN) alternative which replaces the FPAN. It removes the need to store clear text card numbers on any system in the payment chain. A Network Token is unique per each cardholder as well as per merchant which increases the security and reduces the risk of fraud. Like a regular PAN, Network Tokens can be used for completing e-commerce transactions or sharing them with other partners in the payment eco-system.&#x20;

We at PCI Proxy provide a solution which enables you to create such Network Tokens while keeping the normal PCI Proxy integrations, processes and tokens. This allows you to benefit from industry leading advantages of PCI Proxy such as a simple technical integration, a fully Payment Provider agnostic solution and best practice in-built security while not changing anything. In short, you still have the full flexibility without touching sensitive payment data.&#x20;

Network Tokenization comes with many more benefits on top. See below how Network Tokens can help you to benefit from our future proof solution.&#x20;
