## 3. Redirect a SFTP-Receiver through PCI Proxy

If you have added a SFTP-Receiver to your account, you can easily redirect requests to that SFTP-Receiver via the PCI Proxy. Requests can be sent as follows:

### 3a. Use simple Post

1. Put `token` instead of `sensitive card data` into your request

2. Use [`PCI Proxy Endpoint`](#reference) as HOST with following paramters `merchantId` , `sign` , `url` , `password` and define `type` with `BTA` or `TAMARA`

3. Add required [`X-CC HTTP`](#reference) header to your request

```
$curl 'https://api.sandbox.datatrans.com/upp/services/v1/proxy/ft?merchantId=XXX&sign=XXX&url=sftp://username@127.0.0.1/folder/test-filename.txt&password=XXX&type=BTA'
    -X POST                                                     // Request Method POST

    -H "X-CC-Authorization: xxxxxx"                             // Basic-Auth
    -H "X-CC-Cache-Control: no-cache"                           // Cache-Control
    -H "X-CC-Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8"           // Accepted: 'text/plan'; 'application/json'; 'application/xml'
    -d '0000080915K...'                                         // define the content
```

The service responds based on the _accept header_: Supported are_text/plain, application/json _\(default\) and _application/xml_

### 3b. Use x-www-form-url encoded

1. Put `token` instead of `sensitive card data` into your request

2. Use [`PCI Proxy Endpoint`](#reference) as `HOST`

3. Add required [`parameter`](#reference) to your request

4. Add required POST data: `merchantID`, `sign`, `url`, `file` and `password`

```
$curl https://api.sandbox.datatrans.com/upp/services/v1/proxy/ft                           // HOST: PCI Proxy Endpoint
    -X POST                                                                                // Request Method POST
    -H "X-CC-Accept: text/plain"                                                           // NEW HEADER: Please choose text/plain
    -H "X-CC-Cache-Control: no-cache"                                                      // NEW HEADER: Please choose no-cache
    -H "X-CC-Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8"               // NEW HEADER: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8

    -d 'merchantId=1000011011                                                              // Merchant ID you received during Signup
    &sign=30916165706580013                                                                // Security Sign you created in Step 1 
    &url=sftp%3A%2F%2Fint-tests%40127.0.0.1%2Ffolder%2Ftest.txt                            // SFTP Endpoint
    &file=SOME+FILE+CONTENT                                                                // Your File
    &password=XXX                                                                          // Your password
    &type=BTA'                                                                             // BTA or TAMARA
```

You have securely forwarded sensitive card data without ever touching your servers. Your request had been populated with sensitive card data while it was routed through PCI Proxy. Thereby, your Receiver obtained full credit card data.

_Note: In test mode, only test credit cards are allowed!_
