# Wallet tokenisation

Use the PCI Proxy wallet tokenisation integrations to collect and tokenize cards stored in digital wallets such as Google and Apple Pay. Place a wallet button in your checkout and offer a secure, fast and seaming-less payment experience when booking your services. When the cardholder selects Google or Apple Pay, a payment sheet with his stored cards is presented and makes the manual card entry redundant. Each wallet transaction needs to be authenticated through Face- or Touch ID and therefore increases the security. &#x20;

As a certified Google Pay and Apple Pay payment provider, PCI Proxy/Datatrans is able to receive and decrypt wallet specific tokens to the underlying FPAN (Full PAN), DPAN (Device PAN) or Network Token. \
\
By converting the wallet tokens to a PCI Proxy alias, your business stands to gain numerous benefits such as payment provider agnostic tokens, full flexibility, a minimised PCI DSS scope and battle prove security of your customers payment data.&#x20;

PCI Proxy supports different integration methods of Google and Apple Pay. Please refer to the options below to identify the method that aligns with your requirements and delve deeper into the unique strengths and nuances of each approach.
