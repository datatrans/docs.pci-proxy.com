# Wallet tokenisation - Web

The direct wallet tokenisation integration method offers you complete flexibility and control over the look and feel and the payment flow in your web checkout. &#x20;

It requires you to implement the respectively payment apis of the wallet provider directly. Once this is done, you can add the wallet payment button on your checkout page and start requesting encrypted card data from your customers. Send this encrypted card data to the PCI Proxy Vault API to convert a wallet token into a PCI Proxy alias.&#x20;

A high level high-level process flow when using the direct integration of the wallets can be found below - it works similar for both wallets, Google and Apple Pay.&#x20;
