# Setup your Sandbox \(Test\) Environment

Before taking your integration live, use our Sandbox environment to test it thoroughly. The Sandbox environment is a self-contained testing environment, identical to our productive environment.

## 1. Create your Sandbox Account

Follow these steps to create your Sandbox account:
