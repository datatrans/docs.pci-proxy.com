# Network Tokens \(beta\)

PCI Proxy Network Tokenisation service is a beta feature which enables merchants to increase their payment success rate and improve their security. 

As of today, Datatrans/PCI Proxy is a certified Token Requestor Provider for Visa \(VTS\) and MasterCard \(MDES\) network tokenisation. Support for American Express \(AETS\) will be added later this year. 

### **Network Tokens**

Network Tokenisation is a concept introduced by the card schemes such as Visa, Mastercard and AMEX. Based on the technical framework provided by Emvco \([https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/payment-tokenisation/](https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/payment-tokenisation/)\).  
Thereby, a Network Token \(also called DPAN\) is a 16 digit Primary Account Number \(PAN\) alternative which is unique per each cardholder as well as per mechant. Like a regular PAN, Network Tokens can be used for completing ecom transactions or sharing them with other partners in the payment eco-system. 

By using PCI Proxy APIs a Network Token will be automatically generated once a cardnumber is collected - without any further implementation effort on your side.
