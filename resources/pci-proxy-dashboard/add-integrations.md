# Add Integrations

You can filter payloads by adding an integration to your account. PCI Proxy provides you with over 400 preconfigured integrations to partners across all industries. In case you're missing one, add it within minutes by providing us with payload samples and related endpoints.

2. Check the endpoint of the integration and press **Install**&#x20;
3. Check if the payload fits your example and press again **Activate** to finish the installation.
