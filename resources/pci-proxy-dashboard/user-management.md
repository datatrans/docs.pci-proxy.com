# User management

As the creator of the sandbox account you are automatically assigned with administrator permissions for the overall contract. As an administrator you are allowed to invite new users to either Contracts or Projects. For each new user you can assign various roles and access rights to them.&#x20;

Navigate to the <mark style="color:blue;">**Users**</mark> menu within the <mark style="color:blue;">**Contract**</mark> section <mark style="color:blue;"></mark> to invite new users:&#x20;
