# PCI DSS Validation

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store or transmit payment information maintain a secure environment. The PCI DSS applies to any organization, regardless of size or number of transactions, that accepts, transmits or stores any payment data, such as payment processors, acquirers, issuers, and service providers.

Using the <mark style="color:blue;">**Forward Proxy**</mark>** ** allows you to distribute sensitive payment data freely across PCI-compliant endpoints (Receivers). In order to ensure that you only share payment data with compliant and trustworthy Receivers, we help you to validate the compliance status of the respectively third-party Receiver to ensure continued protection of your customers' payment data.
