# Account structure / User management

## Account structure

With PCI Proxy you have one single company account \(legal entity\) and one single login. Independently of your active subscription plan and test or productive environment.   
  
This company account is called **Contract** and can hold, based on your subscription plan,  one to several sub-accounts \(**Projects**\). Each **Contract** must contain at least one legally authorized user. Furthermore the invoice is always issued at **Contract** level.   
  
User can be assigned either on **Contract** or **Project** level. Please refer to User management to learn more about the roles and permissions.   

**Create a new Project**  
Within the Scale and Enterprise subscription plan you're allowed to create multiple Projects**.** 

1\) Navigate to the top left corner and open the drop down menu.  
2\) Click on the plus button to create a new Project  
3\) Enter a name for the new Project  
4\) Continue with setting up new integrations

**Project overview / Switching between Projects**  
  
Navigate to the **Projects** menu in the Contract section to get an overview about all your projects. The graphs here show the volume cumulated over all Projects.   
  
To switch to one specific dashboard simply press the Switch to project button below the Workspace title or navigate to the top left drop down menu - open it and choose the desired Project. 

## User management

Navigate to the **Users** menu within the **Contract section** to find the user management.  
  
As the creator of the sandbox account you are automatically assigned with admin permissions for the overall contract. As an admin you are allowed to invite new users to either Contracts or Projects. For each new user you can assign various roles and access rights to them.   
  
Have a look at below mentioned table for detailed user roles. Learn more about the [Account structure](account-structure-user-management.md).
